# The Fat Duck Tavern â€” Restaurant Booking System

Welcome to *The Fat Duck Tavern*, a full-stack web application designed to provide users with a seamless online table booking experience. This project was developed as part of a full-stack development course and showcases modern web development best practices, including responsive frontend design, a robust backend API, secure authentication, and cloud deployment.

---

## Project Overview

The Fat Duck Tavern app allows visitors to:

- View restaurant information, including the menu and contact details
- Book tables online by submitting a reservation form with validation to prevent duplicate bookings
- Receive a confirmation page summarizing their booking details

Administrators can manage bookings securely through the Django admin interface.

The system is built with Django on the backend and standard HTML/CSS on the frontend, focusing on clean UX, accessibility, and maintainability.

## Testing

Automated and manual tests have been conducted to ensure:

- Booking form validation works as expected
- Navigation links function correctly
- Access restrictions to admin pages are enforced
- Static files load properly in production

### Booking Form Manual Tests

#### Successful Booking
1. Go to `/book/`, fill in valid data, and submit
2. **Expected:** Redirect to confirmation page showing name, date, time, and guest count

#### Duplicate Booking Prevention
1. Revisit `/book/`, submit the same email/date/time as above
2. **Expected:** The form reloads with the error message "You already have a booking at that time."

#### Required Fields Validation
1. **Action:** Submit the booking form without filling in any fields
2. **Expected:** Each required field displays the error message "This field is required."

### JavaScript / UI Manual Tests

#### Mobile Navigation (Burger Menu)
1. Resize browser to mobile width or open on a phone
2. Click the burger icon
3. **Expected:** The nav menu expands and collapses

All tests were performed on Chrome and Django's development server.
